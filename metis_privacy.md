## Metis

Metis is a privacy driven instant messenger based on Jupiters blockchain. There a various levels that ensure privacy and security, but also some things to be aware of, to not end up exposed, even though you think you still are while using it.

### Security

Metis' security is ensured by a double layer encryption (AES256). 

The first layer is your "normal" blockchain encryption - everything is secured with your private key. A Metis account can be used as a normal Jupiter account in terms of sending and receiving coins and assets (but not every Jupiter account is usable for metis as they lack some special parameters). Every message on this layer is also encrypted and can be read with your private key - on Jupiter it is the 12 word-passphrase.

Metis now adds a second layer of encryption with the password you provided on registration. This means, someone that wants to read your messages needs the  passphrase (private key of your wallet) and this password - or access to your unlocked device of course!

If someone is able to get your passphrase, he can empty the wallet, but not read the messages!

Quantum-Computing is a danger, that is currently not able to decrypt your messages, but in the future it maybe possible. But remember, if your Metis-messages can be read, the whole world is big trouble, because everything else is also not safe anymore...

### Privacy

Metis is not using any data from your phone, it just gets access to your blockchain-account and thats it. However, Jupiter is a public blockchain, means every transaction is transparent and can be analyzed. For better usability, the blockchain-feature "alias" is used. So the nickname you choose on registration is an alias and connected to the metis-account (the jup-address).

- If you use your real name as an alias, your level of privacy is significantly reduced 

Metis works with channels/rooms, they are also a Jupiter-address. If you are chatting with one other person, you both are sending messages to this room. The name of the room is not readable by anyone else than the users. But all users participating can be seen on the chain.

- If anyone of the people you are communicating with, uses his/her real name for the alias, this also gives some information to the public

As said, a Metis-account can be used as a normal wallet or if you use it heavily with all its features and funcions that are planned, you might need to fund the Metis account. This is also trackable and even if you currently are able to only buy Jupiters wrapped tokens on ETH or BSC, there is a chance to follow the transactions through the swap process.

- If you fund your Metis-account from an exchange account where you are registered with your private data, your privacy is gone if it comes to legal operations from governments that ask exchanges for user data.

### Counter measures

- Jupiter supports shuffling on chain, so it is possible to hide from where the funds are coming. As every mixer, the function depends on the amount if users using it.
- Use an account that is not verified to buy tokens on an exchange - still not perfect, there are other possibilities to track you (ip-address, email-address), but is also possible to be safe here.
- Buy coins on dex (Uniswap, pancakeswap). Just be sure, that your BNB and ETH is not easily trackable.



### Last thought

It is of course not very likely, that your communication is tracked. The real strength of Metis is, that no company can use your data/communication, as nobody has access to it. Also the metadata provided by a public blockchain is limited. But you should always remember, the main advantage of a blockchain - immutably stored forever - could also be a disadvantage later, when you are not careful with your private information. Metis can support you here but is no guarantee against human failure.
