### Use Case of ASTRO

ASTRO was introduced to have an Asset with higher risk but also better rewards than FORGE. There was an initial sell on the wallet-integrated JUP-DEX. The price started at 0.75JUP/ASTRO and increased when the sellorder was sold out. After 8 days, every unsold ASTRO-Token was burned to limit the supply.

Unlike FORGE, ASTRO will be traded on JUP-DEX, so that there is no guarantee, that you can sell your ASTRO 1:1 as you bought it - that is one of the risks. Another risks are for example:

- unknown how long rewards are paid
- unknown how long the rewards will stay on this level or if they will change in the future

So your APY with ASTRO is depending on several factors, mainly driven by the buy-price on the JUP-DEX. The rewards are paid hourly. All you need to do to is buy ASTRO and hold them. Currently, every hour 3.5k JUP are rewarded to ASTRO-Holders
